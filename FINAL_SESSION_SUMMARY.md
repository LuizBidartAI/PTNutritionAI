- **Solution**: Fixed URL construction and endpoint formatting
- **Result**: Successful Azure AI integration with personalized coaching responses

### 2. **Pydantic Deprecation Warnings**
- **Problem**: `.dict()` method deprecation warnings in console
- **Root Cause**: Using outdated Pydantic v1 syntax
- **Solution**: Updated to `.model_dump()` for Pydantic v2 compatibility
- **Result**: Clean console output without deprecation warnings

### 3. **Chat UI/UX Issues**
- **Problem**: Poor message visibility, inadequate scrolling behavior
- **Root Cause**: Basic styling with limited chat container functionality
- **Solution**: Implemented ChatGPT-style message bubbles with enhanced CSS
- **Result**: Professional chat interface with excellent user experience

### 4. **Computer Vision Integration**
- **Problem**: Automatic responses instead of real image analysis
- **Root Cause**: Using outdated Computer Vision API v3.2
- **Solution**: Updated to Computer Vision 4.0 API with proper parameters
- **Result**: Real food detection and nutritional analysis from uploaded photos

### 5. **Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Problem**: Hardcoded API keys in repository triggering GitHub secret scanning
- **Root Cause**: Direct inclusion of Azure credentials in source code
- **Solution**: Replaced with environment variables and secure configuration templates
- **Result**: Repository complies with security best practices and GitHub policies
